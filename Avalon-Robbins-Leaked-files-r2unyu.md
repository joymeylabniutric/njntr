Born in 1995, Avalon Robbins grew up in a musical family and began singing at a young age. She was heavily influenced by artists such as Adele, Florence + The Machine, and Lorde, and began writing her own songs as a teenager. After completing her education, Avalon Robbins released her debut single "Lost in the Moment" in 2017, which quickly gained traction online and caught the attention of music industry professionals.
